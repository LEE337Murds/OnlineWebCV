        <p>
        I was a top student in high school and always placed top 5 in my class. I excelled in all the various subjects.
        I matriculated with 6 A's and an aggregate of 87%.
        I was also an avid hockey player and played 3 years for the first team.
        School was a good experience for me as learning new concepts came easy to me.

          <p>
         I didn't know what i wanted to study straight out of highschool. My father was a dentist and the medical field
         interested me. I completed my PreMed and began working as a student intern. Between the 30 hour shifts and the 
         volume of theory they wanted me to study inbetween shifts, i fell out of love with the medical field and decided 
         to focus on my interests and what makes me happy: Technology.
         I gained so much experience during my time in the medical field. I spoke to a hundreds of people i would otherwise never have met and 
         developed my ability to speak afrikaans.
